	<p1>Domonique Wilson is a 33 year old female born and raised in Philadelphia, PA. Domonique has been vegan since October of 2017 and has been going strong ever since. She made this decision to become vegan after years of dealing with different types of sickness with unexplained reasons that doctors could not pinpoint. She spent much time doing her own research about the human body, the nutrients that it needs and the best ways to get them. After doing this research and lastly stumbling upon a documentary called "What The Health", she decided that this was the best health decision for her. Ever since she has made this change, she has never felt better! It has changed her in many ways physically, spiritually and mentally. She is loving her new glow and hopes to only inspire others who want the same! Welcome to Vegan Vibes! </p1><br>
